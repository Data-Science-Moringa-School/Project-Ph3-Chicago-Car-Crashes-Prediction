This project aims to build a machine learning classifier to predict the primary contributory cause of car accidents in Chicago, using data on vehicle details, road conditions, and information about the people involved in the accidents. By analyzing various factors, the model provides insights that can help the Vehicle Safety Board and the City of Chicago identify key patterns and implement targeted interventions to reduce traffic accidents and improve road safety. This multi-class classification problem requires careful handling of imbalanced data and feature engineering to ensure accurate and actionable predictions.

**Key Stakeholders**
Vehicle Safety Board: Interested in identifying and mitigating the most common causes of traffic accidents to improve vehicle and road safety.
City of Chicago: Seeks to reduce the number of traffic accidents and improve public safety through data-driven decision-making and targeted interventions.
Insurance Companies: May use the insights to assess risks and develop pricing strategies based on accident causes.




## Business Problem

The City of Chicago faces a persistent challenge with traffic accidents, which result in numerous injuries, fatalities, and financial losses each year. The complexity of these incidents, driven by a wide array of factors including road conditions, vehicle characteristics, and human behavior, makes it difficult for authorities to accurately identify the root causes and implement effective prevention strategies. This project seeks to address this issue by developing a machine learning model that can predict the primary contributory cause of car accidents. By analyzing detailed data on the vehicles involved, the people in the cars, and the environmental conditions at the time of the accidents, the model aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform policy decisions. The ultimate goal is to equip the Vehicle Safety Board and City of Chicago officials with actionable information to reduce the occurrence and severity of traffic accidents, enhancing public safety and optimizing resource allocation for traffic management and accident prevention initiatives.


## Data & Methods
The project uses the following datasets:

- [Traffic Crashes - Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if)
- [Traffic Crashes - People](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-People/u6pd-qa9d)
- [Traffic Crashes - Vehicles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Vehicles/68nd-jvt3)

We created a `TARGET` column based on the injury that each individual person incurred during the crash which divided our target class into 4 categories. This resulted in a highly imbalanced dataset.
